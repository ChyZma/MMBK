C:/projects/moq4/src/Moq/SetupCollection.cs:107: warning: Thread Safety Violation
  Read/Write race. Non-private method `SetupCollection.FindLast(...)` reads without synchronization from container `this.Moq.SetupCollection.setups` via call to `List`1<!0>.get_Count()`. Potentially races with write in method `SetupCollection.Clear()`.
 Reporting because this access may occur on a background thread.
